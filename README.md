The goal of this project is to build lasso related functionality into the existing drmdel package. It is inspired by the derivation of the Group Lasso Estimator for Density Ratio Models in my Masters thesis. Building this functionaility directly into the C codebase will greatly improve the efficiency of optimizing the objective functions.

All credit for the original project goes to the author Dr. Song Cai.
